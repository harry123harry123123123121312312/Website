    <h2> What is the best breed of cat to get? </h2>
    <p> In my opinion persian or pixie bob are the best breed of cats to get because pixie bobs are very cute, fluffy, friendly and they make funny poses! I personally have one called Puszcek (Meaning Fluffy in Polish) and he is by far one of my favourite cats as he is exactly what you'd expect from a cat. </p>

      Persian cats on the other hand are also cute, fluffy, friendly and sleep in even <strong>funnier</strong> positions, and they have a constant grumpy look to them that only adds to the cutness!
